              data typically needed to feed these advanced models. While these
              institutions can leverage external data sources, concerns over
              data privacy and the cost associated with procuring such data

              Advanced credit decisioning models are a linchpin for community
              banks and regional credit unions striving to maintain a

              Traditional credit scoring models may not be able to accurately
              evaluate the creditworthiness of certain customers, particularly
              those with thin credit files or non-traditional credit
              histories. Advanced credit decisioning models can incorporate a
              broader range of data, enabling these institutions to more
              accurately evaluate such customers and potentially expand their
              customer base (See: Journal of Consumer Affairs, 2021).
              Moreover, by providing quicker, more accurate credit decisions,

              Best Practices for Implementation
            </h3>
            <p class="font-family-plus-jakarta-sans fs-5 fw-normal lh-1.5 mb-3"
              style="text-align: left; color: #546662">
              <span class="fw-bold">Modular Implementation Approach: </span>
              While a singular optimization algorithm run over a consolidated
              database theoretically delivers an optimal model, industry
              leaders favor a modular architecture. This incorporates multiple
              sub-models based on data coverage, industry and geographic
              variations. These modules, which are combined to yield a single,
              overarching credit signal, can be easily added or removed,
              allowing for the integration of new or differing data.
              Consequently, the model remains flexible and robust.
              Implementing this architecture requires coordination among
              stakeholders including the business, model development team, and
              model maintenance team.

              <span class="fw-bold">Explore Data Sources:</span> Top
              performers utilize a blend of internal and external data sources
              to bolster the predictive power of credit signals. Traditional
              internal data is combined with non-traditional data and enriched
              with traditional external data. Other external non-traditional
              data sources are also explored, including subjective data from
              Relationship Managers and underwriters to fill gaps. Open
              banking and non-traditional external data such as telecom and
              social media data can provide valuable insights into customer
              behaviors.

              at mining existing data and combining data sources to extract
              highly predictive credit signals. They leverage machine learning
              (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to form a more complete,
              albeit slightly imprecise, view of the customers. Advanced banks
              leverage deep analytics and apply ML and AI in areas such as
              creating segmentation rules, deriving credit signals, and
              building and validating challenger models.

              <span class="fw-bold">Business Expertise:</span> While ML and AI
              are powerful tools, they should not be the sole basis of credit
              models. Banks should leverage internal business expertise during
              the model development process to better understand where credit
              signals are missing, and then identify and validate new credit
              signals. Model designers should consult with underwriters and
              Relationship Managers to translate their insights into
              qualitative questions for better credit signaling.

              make more accurate and informed credit decisions, respond
              swiftly to economic disruptions, uncover new growth areas, and

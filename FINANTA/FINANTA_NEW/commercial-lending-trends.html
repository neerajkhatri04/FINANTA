                shifting market demands. While players in this market are

                decisioning models are all but necessary for players to thrive
                in the current commercial lending landscape. Transitioning to
                such new models is not easy. Many banks face challenges due to
                limited data sources, simple analytical tools, reliance on
                subjective assessments, outdated and inflexible models, and

                to 40%. Automating many aspects of the assessment process and
                eliminating much of the paperwork helps quickly identify the
                right customers and improve their experience using
                straight-through processing. Precise default risk predictions
                allows lenders to identify the level of provisions and capital
                they must hold, and case prioritization through automation
                allows lenders to pay more attention to assess high-risk but

                customers who value the improved user experience, and minimize
                risk by segmentation. The advent of advanced credit decisioning

                Tightening regulations are part of a broader push for increased

                From speeding up approvals to fulfilling compliance
                requirements, lenders are resorting to technology to meet
                business demands. Technology is able to automate loan document
                reviews, flag exceptions and even ensure adherence to
                regulations both local and federal, letting underwriters focus
                on higher-value tasks.

                An end-to-end software solution is perhaps the only answer to
                the contradictory commercial lending space. New business
                applications are at a record high, but so are US interest rates.
                Technological transformation is underway, but it appears to be
                on a piecemeal basis. Borrowers want personalized and
                streamlined experiences, but this requires precise credit
                decisioning models. Compliance requirements change from state to
                state – unheard of until recently. Sustainable lending and ESG
                principles are rapidly coming to the forefront, but are also
                subject to serious risks. Financial institutions have to
                capitalize on current trends or risk becoming obsolete.

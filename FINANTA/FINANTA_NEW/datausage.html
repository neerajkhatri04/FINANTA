          <p>
            Finanta blog posts, reports, and slide decks are protected by
            copyright and may not be republished in their entirety. If you wish
            to publish more than one-quarter of the content from a given Finanta
            report, you must obtain prior approval from Finanta as outlined
            above.
          </p>

          <h5>How to Cite Finanta Data or Reports?</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Source</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When publishing Finanta data, you must clearly indicate the specific
            Finanta blog post or report, as applicable. The appropriate Finanta
            URL must be included. If you are citing Finanta social media posts,
            please provide a link or abbreviated link to that source. If you
            cite Finanta data alongside other data, including your own, you must
            clearly indicate which data points came from which source.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Screenshots</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you are publishing screenshots of Finanta tables, charts, or
            other content that are in the public domain, the Finanta logo must
            be clearly visible in the screenshots.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Quotes</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When quoting Finanta content or analyses that are available in the
            public domain, quotes should be used in full context and preserve
            the original intended meaning. The source should be the specific
            Finanta blog post, report, or press release along with the
            appropriate Finanta URL. For Finanta commentary that has not already
            been published in the public domain, you may quote only official
            company spokespersons with their approval. Such officials include
            members of the executive team and Business Development leaders at
            the VP level or higher.
          </p>

          <h5>Disclaimers</h5>

          <p>
            Any Finanta data or analysis about a financial product, service, or
            market does not represent an endorsement by Finanta, nor should they
            be cited in such a way as to imply that. In addition to this policy,

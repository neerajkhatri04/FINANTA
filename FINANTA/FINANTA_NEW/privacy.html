              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="fw-bold pt-3">4. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal
            information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your
            information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where
            you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our
            Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
            We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is
            not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your
            personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your
            personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of
            personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for
            circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
            on the Website.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bold pt-3">5. Data Retention</h3>

          <p>
            We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an
            ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide
            you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
            legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if
            this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
            your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
            until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bold pt-3">

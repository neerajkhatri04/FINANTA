                    Such loans also have more flexible credit structures than

                The key virtue of a commercial loan is it gives businesses quick
                access to money – especially as regulations forbid them from
                raising funds from the bond or equity markets. Commercial
                lending has time and again helped the US thrive – it played a
                pivotal role in the economic booms of post-Civil War and
                post-World War II America – mainly by funneling the savings of
                citizens to entrepreneurs.

                All lenders look for much the same things when deciding on
                giving out a loan. A history of regular payments and low debt
                increases your chances of approval. A steady flow of revenue
                means the business is in good financial health. Collateral is
                not only a minimum requirement, but in most cases, its value
                directly impacts loan terms.

                Modern credit analysis essentially helps lenders decide whether
                an applicant gets a loan or not – it is the lynchpin of
                commercial lending and is computed using several metrics:

                <span class="fw-bold">Credit scoring:</span>

                tell the lender the chance of the borrower defaulting, mainly by
                analyzing their financial conduct – and this is one of the means

                <span class="fw-bold">Financial ratios:</span>
                While the credit score looks into the borrowers’ financial

                . Ratios such as a company’s debt-to-equity ratio, interest

                Credit analysis is the foundation on which a lender issues a

                periods, but also protects both the borrower and the lender and
                helps stabilize the economy – from the earliest periods in free
                America’s history, sound lending practices have directly led to

                Recent regulations at both the federal and local level do not
                fall under a unified framework – and if that wasn’t complicated

                Players in this space don’t just have to prepare for tighter
                regulations, but new regulations that promote sustainable
                businesses or green lending – and this comes with its own
                challenges. Lenders cannot just cut out ‘brown’ businesses and
                shift to the green lending space as it comes with its own risks.

                There is only one constant in commercial lending in the US: the
                need for advanced technology. As discussed above, America has
                historically thrived when businesses and entrepreneurs have had
                ready access to funding, and if regulations make technology
                adoption necessary to fuel business ambitions, then an
                end-to-end commercial lending platform is a necessity.

                Whenever American lenders practiced sound lending policies, the
                nation didn’t just prosper, it boomed. Today, this market is a
                fragmented space with banks, credit unions and non-bank lenders
                all offering a variety of terms – a far cry from the low-risk
                loans made out mainly by a

                No borrower is likely to tolerate a fragmented space where terms
                and policies change wherever they turn. Technology needs to
                unify this market if today’s lenders want to fuel the dreams of
                today’s businesses, just as those before did so.

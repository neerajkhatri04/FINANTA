                A commercial loan is a debt instrument advanced to support
                business activity and growth – and it’s at least as old as the
                age of agriculture. Commercial lending has been crucial in
                fuelling economic growth in the US and continues to power
                businesses with various credit instruments that allow them to
                purchase equipment, commercial real estate, pay for startup
                costs, and more. In effect, the commercial loan is the lifeblood
                of businesses large and small.

                continue to power a country that has traditionally grown on the
                back of a liberal credit economy.

                A commercial loan is usually given to a business to help with
                its capital requirements – to meet startup costs, payroll
                fulfillment, leasing corporate premises, and more. It has a few
                key characteristics:

                    Such loans require the business to post collateral such as
                    cash, real-estate holdings, plant and equipment, or any
                    asset that the lender can repossess if the business

                    Such loans also have more flexible credit structures than
                    personal loans – in fact, some businesses can qualify for
                    unsecured loans so long as the applicant signs a personal
                    guarantee to pay it back if the business fails. Loans can
                    even be unsecured by collateral, provided the applicant
                    signs a personal guarantee to pay it back in case the
                    business fails.

                An SBA loan is backed by the US Small Business Administration,
                thereby lowering the lender’s risk, enabling them to lend to
                businesses that might otherwise fail to qualify. Both interest
                rates and repayment timelines are favorable, but the application
                process is lengthy and requires the customer to have a credit
                score of at least 680.

                There are other loan types too. Businesses with high sales
                volumes can get merchant cash advances that they can repay with
                sales revenues. Businesses with unpaid invoices can get an
                advance from invoice factors who will collect on their unpaid
                bills. Equipment financiers fund everything from electronics for
                office space to industrial and farming machinery. In these
                cases, the equipment usually becomes the collateral.

                The key virtue of a commercial loan is it gives businesses quick
                access to money – especially as regulations forbid them from
                raising funds from the bond or equity markets. Commercial
                lending has time and again helped the US thrive – it played a
                pivotal role in the economic booms of post-Civil War and
                post-World War II America – mainly by funneling the savings of
                citizens to entrepreneurs.

                Commercial lending in the US has closely followed economic
                cycles. After the Revolutionary War, early banks lent to
                entrepreneurs, helping rebuild the economy. Post-Civil War
                commercial institutions funded infrastructure and industrial
                growth, sparking a second industrial revolution. The Great
                Depression marked the lowest point for commercial lending in the
                US, with loan volumes plummeting nearly 60% as the banking
                system collapsed. Recovery came with reforms like the
                Glass-Steagall Act, and the post-World War II boom, which
                revived lending. However, the Great Recession of 2008 saw a 16%
                drop in loan volumes, echoing past downturns. The most
                transformative change came with the digital age during the ’80s,
                where online lending platforms disrupted traditional banking,
                and we will discuss both traditional and modern players in the
                industry in the following sections.

                businesses.

                Traditional banks have historically funded US businesses large
                and small, offering term loans, lines of credits and financing
                equipment. They have strict lending conditions and require
                excellent credit histories and valuable collateral. Their
                resources and reputations make them a safe choice for many
                businesses, though they are not as flexible as new players.

                <span class="fw-bold">Credit unions:</span>
                Credit unions are cooperatives that provide services much like
                traditional banks, but at looser rates. Their clientele usually
                includes the small and medium-sized businesses that are part of
                the communities in which they operate. Credit unions are smaller
                operations and do not have the lending capacities or the digital
                apparatus that younger businesses owners want.

                <span class="fw-bold">Non-Bank Lenders:</span>
                Neo banks, fintechs and non-bank lenders are attracting
                businesses that won’t qualify under the stringent criteria of
                traditional banks by using technology not only to assess risk
                but also streamline the loan approval process.
                <br />
                While these lenders provide quick access to capital and more
                flexible terms, they also charge higher interest rates because
                of the risks they assume. Marketplace lending essentially cuts
                out the middleman and have proven their mettle in competing
                effectively with the very institutions they seek to bypass.

                Government programs, such as the Small Business Administration
                (SBA), have long supported small businesses by lowering the risk
                that the lender has to assume. But such loans require one to
                undergo a strict screening process and have a strong credit
                history.
                <br />
                Other players include private equity and VC firms who lend to
                startups, insurance firms and savings and loan associations who
                fund commercial real estate projects, and equipment financiers
                who enable customers to buy collateralized equipment.

                All lenders look for much the same things when deciding on
                giving out a loan. A history of regular payments and low debt
                increases your chances of approval. A steady flow of revenue
                means the business is in good financial health. Collateral is
                not only a minimum requirement, but in most cases, its value
                directly impacts loan terms.

                Businesses usually face challenges in securing loans when the
                economy is in a slump – this puts them under pressure to
                demonstrate their financial stability. Rising interest rates
                just make borrowing more costly for everyone, affecting
                businesses as well. New businesses with a short credit history
                can find it hard to show they are credit-worthy, and may be
                scrutinized further or simply rejected. And regulations, both
                federal and local, have now become a minefield for small
                businesses to navigate, and it is worth noting that commercial
                lending wasn’t even regulated at any level until recently.

                The corporate finance institute states that commercial loans
                have far more complicated structures than other loan types, and
                this complexity extends to the screening of applicants as well,
                with credit analysis ultimately deciding whether a business
                secures a loan or not.

                Modern credit analysis essentially helps lenders decide whether
                an applicant gets a loan or not – it is the lynchpin of
                commercial lending and is computed using several metrics:

                <span class="fw-bold">Credit scoring:</span>
                The credit score essentially tells the lender just how risky it
                is to lend to a business. Models like FICO and VantageScore tell
                the lender the chance of the borrower defaulting, mainly by
                analyzing their financial conduct – and this is one of the means
                by which the lender decides the interest rate.

                <span class="fw-bold">Financial ratios:</span>
                While the credit score looks into the borrowers’ financial
                history, financial ratios help scrutinize the company’s
                financial health. Ratios such as a company’s debt-to-equity
                ratio, interest coverage ratio and current ratio help lenders
                determine whether the borrower will be able to repay.

                AI and machine-learning models have taken credit analysis to the
                next level, allowing lenders to parse vast amounts of data and
                make faster credit assessments. Such technologies also reduce
                human error and bias in evaluating collateral and the borrower’s
                capacity to repay.

                Credit analysis is the foundation on which a lender issues a
                loan – not only does it determine interest rates and repayment
                periods, but also protects both the borrower and the lender and
                helps stabilize the economy – from the earliest periods in free
                America’s history, sound lending practices have directly led to
                economic prosperity.

                Commercial Lending in the US: Recent Trends

                Recent trends show that commercial lending is growing despite
                coming under stricter regulatory scrutiny. While the pandemic
                affected all businesses, new businesses are being registered now
                that the world has returned to a new normal. Businesses today
                also want more personalized lending solutions, with flexible
                terms and an all-digital process – this is naturally compelling
                players to adopt technology just to cater to customer needs. New
                and sophisticated credit decisioning models have yielded stellar
                gains in both revenue and efficiency for those who have given
                them a shot, giving such players a competitive edge. In fact,
                even regulatory pressures are now being confronted with
                technology known as ‘RegTech’. But technology adoption appears
                haphazard – some lenders have adopted technology to provide a
                better experience, others have done so to improve credit
                decisioning, still others have used it to plough through the
                regulatory thicket – there is a need for an end-to-end solution
                that employs all such technology to transform commercial
                lending.

                Commercial lending is projected to grow, but it is beset by
                challenges both on the technological and regulatory front,
                pushing players to adapt or be left behind:

                Today’s high interest rates are making borrowing a costly
                proposition for any type of business, and even lenders are
                earmarking funds to cover future losses as interest rates rise.
                Newly-minted regulations at the state and federal levels – which
                do not fall under a single rubric like TILA – are further
                complicating matters for lenders – and banks are finally
                investing in ‘forward-looking analytics’ to better predict, and
                curtail, risk. The unpredictable economic environment and rising
                interest rates are straining borrowers and lenders alike. As
                such, every challenge is an opportunity to innovate, and the
                more complex this space becomes, the greater the need will be
                for a unified solution.

                Commercial lending is poised to grow even as it is coming under
                stricter scrutiny. Experts predict it will grow at an annual
                rate of 13% over the next decade as interest rates across the
                world stabilize. In 2023, North America held the lion’s share –
                about 36% – of this market, and will grow alongside the rest of
                the world, supported by growing demand as businesses return back
                to the office. Commercial loan volumes could see a steady

                Predictive analytics will soon speed up risk assessment, giving

                Recent regulations at both the federal and local level do not
                fall under a unified framework – and if that wasn’t complicated
                enough, new regulations are expected to tighten lending

                Players in this space don’t just have to prepare for tighter
                regulations, but new regulations that promote sustainable
                businesses or green lending – and this comes with its own
                challenges. Lenders cannot just cut out ‘brown’ businesses and
                shift to the green lending space as it comes with its own risks.

                There is only one constant in commercial lending in the US: the
                need for advanced technology. As discussed above, America has
                historically thrived when businesses and entrepreneurs have had
                ready access to funding, and if regulations make technology
                adoption necessary to fuel business ambitions, then an
                end-to-end commercial lending platform is a necessity.

                Whenever American lenders practiced sound lending policies, the
                nation didn’t just prosper, it boomed. Today, this market is a
                fragmented space with banks, credit unions and non-bank lenders
                all offering a variety of terms – a far cry from the low-risk
                loans made out mainly by a small group of financiers to
                merchants and entrepreneurs during post-Civil War America.

                No borrower is likely to tolerate a fragmented space where terms
                and policies change wherever they turn. Technology needs to
                unify this market if today’s lenders want to fuel the dreams of
                today’s businesses, just as those before did so.
